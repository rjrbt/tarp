# tarp [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/verygoodsoftwarenotvirus/tarp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/verygoodsoftwarenotvirus/tarp) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/verygoodsoftwarenotvirus/tarp/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/verygoodsoftwarenotvirus/tarp?branch=master)

`tarp` is a tiny helper library that helps you catch functions which don't have direct unit tests in your Go packages

So say, for instance, you had the following Go file:

```go
package simple

func A() string {
	return "A"
}

func B() string {
	return "B"
}

func C() string {
	return "C"
}

func outer() {
	A()
	B()
	C()
}
```

and you had the following test for that file:

```go
package simple

import (
	"testing"
)

func TestA(t *testing.T) {
	A()
}

func TestC(t *testing.T) {
	C()
}

func TestOuter(t *testing.T) {
	outer()
}
```

Note that `B` doesn't have a direct test the way that `A` and `C` do. `B` is, however, tested in `TestOuter`. This would result in a 100% coverage report, because all the functions are called. What `tarp` seeks to do is catch these sorts of things so that package maintainers can decide what the appropriate course of action is. If you're cool with it, that's cool. If you're not cool with it, then you know what needs to have tests added.

I think `tarp` could also be helpful for new developers looking to contribute towards a project. They can run `tarp` on the package and see if there are some functions they could easily add unit tests for, just to get their feet wet in a project.

`tarp` is currently in active development, and is not yet suitable for use or release. I will update this README when I feel this is no longer the case.

## Wishlist

Things I'd like to see `tarp` be able to do in the future:

- [ ] Use and modify existing coverage profiles generated by `go test` to produce output akin to what `go tool cover -html=coverage.out` produces, only with functions that lack direct tests highlighted in yellow
- [ ] Use [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) to have cool commands (like `tarp analyze` or `tarp cover` for the above)
